						</header>
						<div class="content">

							<p>Kubernetes has become the go-to standard for running containerized applications in production. It is now supported by all major cloud vendors and being open-source, it is a good bet as a foundation for keeping the rest of your stack cloud agnostic.</p>

							<p>But we are not here to sell Kubernetes.</p>

							<p>What we are selling is a unique and effective way of learning Kubernetes (& indeed DevOps) for beginners.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="assets/images/pic02.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>For us, the journey started at PyConUK 2018 where were asked to run a Kubernetes workshop. We had been to many conferences and attended many workshops so we decided to add a little twist to ours:</p>

							<p><strong>Show me or it didn't happen.</strong></p>

							<p>What does this even mean? Well, for instance:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Instead of telling people about how Kubernetes restart pods that fail, we would literally put code in our application that crashes it, hit that code and observe what happens.</li>
								<li>Instead of telling people about Kubernetes manifests, we will not use them, get into trouble and hopefully show exactly why they exist.</li>
								<li>Instead of using toy applications to get the concepts across, we will try and build a clone of a proper production service, fail and noodle around for a solution just like we would in our day jobs.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>It is fair to say that the workshop was very well received and it changed our professional lives forever. Now that it's 2020 & the world seems to have gone to sh*t, we thought it would be fun to reproduce our workshop in the form of a book.</p>
							<p>What can possibly go wrong?</p>

						<h2>About the book?</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="content">
						<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alixedi">Ali</a> & <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-van-der-linden-529a3b26/">Paul</a> have a combined experience of ~30 years doing engineering at startups & ~5 years of using Kubernetes in production & teaching it to other developers.</p>

						<p>Nowadays, they work as consultants which means that they get to tell people what to do instead of doing any work themselves. The upside to this arrangement is that it allows them to e.g. write this book. Long may it continue.</p>

						<p>Head first Kubernetes is as much about Kubernetes as it is about how to learn Computer Science & Software Engineering in general. Ali & Paul stumbled upon this rather unoriginal insight that 99% of Computer Science & indeed Software Engineering can be reproduced on a standard laptop.</p>

						<p>It is therefore suboptimal to tell people about e.g. Docker layers. It is suboptimal to draw diagrams of e.g. Docker layers. It is suboptimal to tell people about the benefits of e.g. Docker layers.</p>

						<p>As opposed to providing people with the tools to observe, fiddle with & even break Docker layers on their own machine:</p>

							<h2>Overview</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>The aim of this book is not to make you a Kubernetes expert overnight. Instead, this book will:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Teach you enough Kubernetes to be dangerous.</li>
								<li>Replace any fears with excitement.</li>
								<li>Improve your judgement about when to reach out for Kubernetes and when to pass.</li>
								<li>Provide you with the vocabulary to tell your colleagues (& your boss) about Kubernetes.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>To that end, this book covers the following topics:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><a href="assets/images/Hello_Docker_World.pdf"><strong>Hello Docker World!</strong></a> - Sample Chapter</li>
								<li>Kubernetes via CLI</li>
								<li>Kubernetes Manifests</li>
								<li>Kubernetes jobs</li>
								<li>Realtime provisioning</li>
								<li>Secret & Config</li>
								<li>Persistent Volumes</li>
								<li>Resource Management</li>
								<li>Introduction to Operators</li>
								<li>More about Auto Scaling</li>
								<li>Conclusion and next steps</li>
